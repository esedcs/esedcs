This article deals with some frequently asked questions about payday loans that will give you a brief summary about these loans and will also put your doubts and queries to rest.

Some FAQ's

1. What is a cash advance or payday loan?

These loans are also known as micro loans and they are short term loans in which borrowings are available at a fixed rate and can be offered as an alternative to credit cards. You can apply for these loans from the privacy of your home and the money gets credited straight into your account. These loans can be used to make payments from day to day running costs and even avoid dishonour payments.

2. How does it work?

Once your loan gets approved your loan ranging from $150 to $750 (this may vary lender to lender) is electronically transferred to your checking account. All payments are online and the repayment is taken electronically from your account.
