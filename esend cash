Payday loans are an easy, but often overlooked, solution to your common financial tribulations. If you find yourself in any of the following situations, you might want to consider researching, and applying for, an online payday loan.

1. Late Cell Phone Bill

Many people don't even have a house phone anymore. Perhaps your cell phone is your only means of communication with family, friends, or ever colleagues. Or, even worse, you might conduct all of your business via cell phone. If this is the case, it might be severely detrimental for your cell phone to be turned off. Even if it's a temporary disconnect I'm sure you don't want your clients to get a message saying, "I'm sorry, the number you have reached is unable to receive calls at this time." Everyone knows that means you have not paid your bill.

2. You are late on your credit card payments

Most often credit card late fees are not dramatically high. However, the late fee combined with your accrued APR might cause you to surpass your credit limit which will add an additional charge to your bill. Not only can this add up quickly, but if you are more than 30 days late your debt will be turned over to credit collections and will cause a negative mark on your report.
